  bio: |-
    I started in the music business in New York City. Today, I'm Managing Director of Product at a world leading Financial Services company leading a team of 150 Product Managers. I live in Atlanta with my wonderful wife and our three children. Like many Product Managers, I too traveled an unusual path to get here. <a href="/about-mark-mitchell">Here’s the full scoop</a>.
